# checklists

Over the years, I have helped many newcomers learn to program and later get their first job. Every time the process repeated itself and we had to figure out again what to do next.

The checklists in this repo are a solution to that problem. It will help beginners from the get go, for each area/market they decide to work on. I will also be able to stop repeating myself, so win-win.

## How to use it

Choose the strategy that best suit you.

### Strategy 1: print the checklist (paper or PDF)

If you're a starter, you probably don't know Git. In that case, you could print it (paper or PDF) and check the items with a pen.

The challenge is that the checklist is constantly changing. If you don't mind about that, it's a good strategy for starters.

### Strategy 2: copy/paste into your todo app

If you use Todo apps like Todoist, Things and Omnifocus, you can just copy and paste the markdown. Dropbox Paper is also a good place to paste.

### Strategy 3: fork the repo

For this you need to know Git.

1. Fork this repo
2. In your repo, check/click the items you've completed
3. When this repo changes, pull those new commits into your repo
4. Push the results to your repo.
