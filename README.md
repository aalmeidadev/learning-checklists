# checklists

Over the years, I have helped many newcomers start learning programming and later get their first job.

This set of checklist will help beginners from the get go, for each area/market they decide to work on. I will also be able to stop repeating myself.

## How to use it

Choose the strategy that best suit you.

### Strategy 1: print the checklist (paper or PDF)

If you're a starter, you probably don't know Git. In that case, you could print it (paper or PDF) and check the items with a pen.

The challenge is that the checklist is constantly changing. If you don't mind about that, it's a good strategy for starters.

### Strategy 2: copy/paste into your todo app

If you use Todo apps like Things and Omnifocus, you can just copy and paste the markdown.

### Strategy 3: fork the repo

For this you need to know Git.

1. Fork this repo
2. In your repo, check/click the items you've completed
3. When this repo changes, pull those new commits into your repo
4. Push the results to your repo.
