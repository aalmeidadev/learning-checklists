# Ruby on Rails

[WIP]

## What's this?

This is a list of things to be learned in order to help guide programming students.

## Who's this for?

This checklist is meant for people who are starting their career with Ruby on Rails and have no experience with programming, but need a guide on what to learn next.

This include other technologies that are commonly used alongside Ruby on Rails, as well as ethics and productivity.

## How to progress on the checklist

Pick an item, then go to Google. In some case there will be links for resources.
Some items require basic understanding about concepts while others mention actual execution.

Try to follow the items in order. They're structured in a way so that you will acquire understanding in more cohesive manner.

It is fine not to follow the checklist items in order, though. Some people will need to learn HTML/CSS, while others will get a project and have to jump into Docker right away.

## Checklist 1: Basics

At this level, you're learning very general concepts about many different topics, without diving into any of them. You're trying to make sense of it all.

- [ ] HTML: what's its purpose? Create an HTML file in your computer and show an image in that page.
- [ ] CSS: what's its purpose? Create a CSS stylesheet in an HTML page, and change some colors to get a basic understanding of how it's used.
- [ ] HTTP: describe an HTTP request 
- [ ] OOP: Understand the concept of Object Oriented Programming and classes.
- [ ] Ruby: have seen syntax for functions (`def`), classes (`class`) and how to instance objects.
- [ ] Understand what is Git.
- [ ] Understand what is Github.
- [ ] Understand what is a database.
- [ ] Basics on how to use the Unix (Linux/Mac) terminal, how to list files, change and create directories.

Then, it's important to understand the basic structure of a Ruby on Rails application. [This tutorial](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) goes through some of the items below and is recommended.

- [ ] Basics about Routes: what are `resources`, `root_path`, `rake routes`
- [ ] Basics about Controllers: what are the 7 actions? How are model instances loaded in controllers?
- [ ] Basics about Views: how are view files organized? Understand what is ERB. How is Ruby code injected inside views? What are helpers and how do you use them?
- [ ] Basics about Models: open `rails console` and list records from the database; create new records.
- [ ] What is `rails server`?
- [ ] What are Model Validations in Rails, and what's its basic syntax.

Beyond Rails:

- [ ] Explain what is a gem.
- [ ] Have cloned a Github repository.
- [ ] Understand the purpose of SQL.
- [ ] What's the difference between some databases.

## Checklist 2: Beginner

At this point you know the basic concepts and how they fit together, although you don't know how to use them. You often ask for help and you're starting to put more effort into the actual commands needed to get things done.

You're also learning new concepts, although from a very high level. Meanwhile, you're getting deeper into some concepts from the previous level.

- [ ] Understand the purpose of the Sidekiq gem.
- [ ] Understand the basics about message queues, what is it and why they are used.
- [ ] Understand why Docker exists and what problems it's trying to solve.

## Checklist 3: Intermediary

At this level you're comfortable doing research and solving problems. You still need help with architectural decisions and you struggle a bit with some concepts, but you can accomplish tasks with confidence.

- [ ] Docker
